# Lemniscate EDScorbot DataSset

In geometry, the lemniscate of Bernoulli is a plane curve defined from two given points F1 and F2, known as foci, at a distance 2c from each other as the locus of points P so that PF1Â·PF2 = c2. See the following figure.

These eight-shaped curves are commonly used in robotics to test and measure a robotic arm's effectiveness. The end-effector of these robots can be programmed to "draw" in their working area these curves.
We have collected different types of information from the ED-Scorobt robotic arm using a set of lemniscates.
